/* stbiw-0.92 - public domain - http://nothings.org/stb/stb_image_write.h
   writes out PNG/BMP/TGA images to C stdio - Sean Barrett 2010
                            no warranty implied; use at your own risk


Before including,

    #define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION

in the file that you want to have the implementation.


ABOUT:

   This header file is a library for writing images to C stdio. It could be
   adapted to write to memory or a general streaming interface; let me know.

   The PNG output is not optimal; it is 20-50% larger than the file
   written by a decent optimizing implementation. This library is designed
   for source code compactness and simplicitly, not optimal image file size
   or run-time performance.
